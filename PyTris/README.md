Tetris clone built in PyGame

left/right arrow keys or a/d keys to move left/right
down or s to move down faster
w or up to drop piece
q/e or shift/? to rotate left/right
escape to pause

rules of Tetris apply - full lines will clear to add points - more lines cleared at once = more points
4 lines cleared at once = Tetris (max points)
will have rule twists (hyper mode, icecap mode, invertTris, no linebar mode, OnlyT's)

will include leaderboard for high score tracking (only for user - maybe eventually add online functionality)
