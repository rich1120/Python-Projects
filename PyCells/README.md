refactor/optimization of "garden" by Mathew K J

Project outline: Was making my own version of this style of program in pygame when I found a youtube video that beat me to it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIDNRQGFP1M

adding more to what is here - more things to play with, a functioning UI, and a screenshot system

**This is meant to be a learning excersise in object oriented programming and cellular automata**
